### Problem Statement:
Our aim of these project is to help develop a trained model that is able to predict and detect the probability of contracting cardio vascular diseases based on a personâ€™s current body readings.

We will do this by passing the model through the cardio vascular dataset we have obtained from kaggle and performing different Exploratory Data Analysis techniques and implementing machine learning models.

### Models Used:
1. 


### Conclusion:
